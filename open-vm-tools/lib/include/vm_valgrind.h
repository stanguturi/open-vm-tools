/*
 * vm_valgrind.h --
 *
 *      This header incorporates the client requests used by Valgrind
 *      (http://www.valgrind.org/) to instrument the binary for dynamic
 *      analysis.
 *
 *      Various hints are available to mark regions of memory as accessible,
 *      inaccessible, defined, undefined, to check the definedness or
 *      accessibliity of regions of memory, or to run code outside of
 *      Valgrind's instrumentation.
 *
 *      See the Valgrind headers for further information.
 *
 *      If USE_VALGRIND is defined, the Valgrind instrumentation macros will
 *      take effect.
 *
 *      If USE_VALGRIND is not defined, the Valgrind instrumentation macros
 *      will still be available but will have no effect (no-op).

 * empty statement, "do { (void)0; } while (0);".  Let's do that ourselves.
